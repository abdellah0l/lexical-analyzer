# Lab Report: Eliminating ε-Transitions from an NFA

## 1. Objective
The goal of this lab was to implement a C program that converts a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton with ε-transitions (ε-NFA) into an equivalent NFA without ε-transitions. This is a fundamental step in the process of converting a regular expression to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA).

## 2. Theoretical Background
An ε-NFA allows transitions on the empty string (ε), meaning the automaton can change states without consuming any input symbol. To eliminate these:
1.  **ε-closure**: For each state $q$, we find the set of all states reachable from $q$ using only ε-transitions.
2.  **New Transitions**: For a state $q$ and symbol $a$, the new transition function $\delta'$ is defined as:
    $$\delta'(q, a) = \epsilon\text{-closure}(\delta(\epsilon\text{-closure}(q), a))$$
3.  **New Final States**: A state $q$ becomes a final state in the new NFA if its ε-closure contains at least one final state from the original ε-NFA.

## 3. Implementation Modules
The program is structured into five main tasks as requested:

### Task 1: Read the NFA
The `read_nfa` function collects the number of states, the alphabet, transitions (including ε), the start state, and the set of final states from the user.

### Task 2: Calculate ε-closure
The `calculate_epsilon_closure` function uses a transitive closure algorithm to find all states reachable via ε-transitions for every state in the NFA.

### Task 3: Compute New Transitions
The `convert_to_nfa` function implements the formula $\delta'(q, a) = \epsilon\text{-closure}(\delta(\epsilon\text{-closure}(q), a))$ to build the transition table for the new NFA.

### Task 4: Determine New Final States
Within the same conversion function, the program checks if any state in a state's ε-closure is a final state. If so, that state is marked as final in the new NFA.

### Task 5: Display the New Automaton
The `display_nfa` function prints the resulting NFA's states, alphabet, start state, final states, and the complete transition table in a readable format.

## 4. Conclusion
The implementation successfully automates the removal of ε-transitions, providing a clean NFA ready for further processing, such as determinization using the subset construction algorithm.
