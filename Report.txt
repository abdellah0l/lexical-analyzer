# Lab Assignment Report: Lexical Analyzer Implementation

## 1. Introduction
The objective of this lab was to implement a **lexical analyzer** in the **C programming language** without using any external tools like Lex or Flex. The analyzer is designed to recognize specific lexical units: identifiers, relational operators, and a specific command structure.

## 2. Lexical Units
The implementation recognizes the following tokens:

### 2.1 Identifiers
Defined by the regular expression `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*`. These are used for command names and arguments.

### 2.2 Relational Operators
The analyzer recognizes the following operators:
- `<` (Less than)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `==` (Equal to)
- `<>` (Not equal to)

### 2.3 Command Structure
A command consists of:
1.  **Command Name**: An identifier.
2.  **Arguments**: An optional list of identifiers.
3.  **Options**: An optional list enclosed in `[` and `]`, containing single-character options preceded by a hyphen (e.g., `-a`), separated by commas.

## 3. Implementation Details
The lexical analyzer is implemented using a simple state-based approach in C.

### 3.1 Token Structure
A `Token` structure was defined to store the type of the token and its corresponding lexeme:
```c
typedef struct {
    TokenType type;
    char lexeme[256];
} Token;
```

### 3.2 Scanning Logic
The `get_next_token()` function reads the input string character by character:
-   **Whitespace**: Skipped automatically.
-   **Identifiers**: Recognized by checking for an initial letter followed by alphanumeric characters.
-   **Operators**: Recognized by checking for `<`, `>`, `=`, and `!`, then looking ahead for a second character (like `=` or `>`).
-   **Symbols**: Single characters like `[`, `]`, `,`, and `-` are recognized as specific tokens to support the command syntax.

## 4. Testing
The implementation was tested with various inputs, including:
-   `macom arg1 arg2 [-a,-b]`
-   `macom [-f]`
-   `macom`
-   Relational expressions like `x <= y` and `a <> b`.

## 5. Conclusion
The lexical analyzer successfully identifies all required lexemes and handles the specified command format. The implementation adheres to the constraint of using only standard C without Lex/Flex.
